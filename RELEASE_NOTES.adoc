= Release Notes: v0.6.7 to v0.7.1

== Overview

This release introduces significant enhancements to the lutaml-model library, focusing on improved handling of missing values, comprehensive polymorphic model support, and important bug fixes. This document outlines the key changes and provides guidance for upgrading your codebase.

== Key changes

=== Missing values handling family

A comprehensive set of features for handling the "missing values" family (empty,
non-existent, and undefined values) across different serialization formats has
been introduced.

WARNING: The default behavior for handling uninitialized collection attributes
is changed from before.

In version 0.6.7, an uninitialized collection attribute in Lutaml::Model is
represented as an empty array (`[]`).

In version 0.7.1, an uninitialized collection attribute in Lutaml::Model is
represented as `nil`.

This change is made to ensure consistency across different serialization formats
and to provide a predictable and consistent behavior based on explicit
declarations when dealing with missing values.

Previously, Lutaml::Model had a limited ability to handle the missing value types,
for example, the appearance and round-trip behavior of the blank XML element
is uncertain. Lutaml::Model also did not support XML `nil` and YAML `null` values
in a consistent manner, nor the inconsistency where TOML does not support
the notion of `nil` or `null` values.

This change may break existing code that relies on the previous behavior. If you
were using uninitialized collection attributes in your code, you may need to
update your code to handle the new behavior.

There is now a series of features to support the missing values family, including:

* Attribute-level `initialize_empty` option, which controls the default
initialization behavior of collection attributes. Previously, collection
attributes defaulted to an empty array (`[]`) when uninitialized. The default
is now the value `nil`.
+
Revert to legacy behavior: You can return to the previous behavior by setting
`initialize_empty: true` in the attribute definition.

* Mapping-rule-level `render_nil` and `render_empty` options have been revamped
into accepting additional options that are used to control how nil and empty
values are parsed from and rendered in serialization formats.
+
The behavior of `render_nil: true` and `render_empty: true` is now equivalent to
`render_nil: :as_empty` and `render_empty: :as_empty`, respectively.
It is strongly recommended that the legacy behavior be replaced with the new
options.
+
The reason being that legacy behavior breaks round-trips between conversions of
the same format. In the case of `render_nil: true`, a model value of `nil` is
serialized into an XML blank element, but when the XML blank element is
deserialized, it is deserialized into an empty string (`""`, as per the W3C XML
standard), not `nil`.

* Mapping-rule-level `value_map` option, which provides fine-grained control
over how missing values are handled during serialization and deserialization.

* Support for a new `Uninitialized` value at the `Lutaml::Model` level, which is
used to represent uninitialized attributes.
+
This means that if you have a model with an attribute that is not set, it will
be represented as `Uninitialized` instead of `nil`. This is useful for
distinguishing between an attribute that is not set and an attribute that is
set to `nil`, and as a result will preserve the round-trip behavior of
serialization formats.

* Support for `nil` values in JSON and YAML, and XML serialization formats.
+
The `nil` value is now supported in JSON, YAML and XML serialization formats.
This means that if you have a model with an attribute that is set to `nil`, it
will be serialized as `null` in JSON/YAML and as an empty element in XML. This
is useful for representing missing values in a consistent manner across
different serialization formats.



==== `initialize_empty` option

The `initialize_empty` option controls the default initialization behavior of
collection attributes:

[source,ruby]
----
# Default to `nil`
class SomeModel < Lutaml::Model::Serializable
  attribute :coll, :string, collection: true

  xml do
    root "some-model"
    map_element 'collection', to: :coll
  end
end
puts SomeModel.new.coll  # => nil

# Default to empty array
class SomeModel < Lutaml::Model::Serializable
  attribute :coll, :string, collection: true, initialize_empty: true

  xml do
    map_element 'collection', to: :coll
  end
end
puts SomeModel.new.coll  # => []
----

==== `value_map` option

The `value_map` option provides fine-grained control over how missing values are handled during serialization and deserialization. This is especially useful when different serialization formats represent missing values differently.

[source,ruby]
----
class ExampleClass < Lutaml::Model::Serializable
  attribute :status, :string

  xml do
    map_element 'status', to: :status, value_map: {
      from: { empty: :nil, omitted: :omitted, nil: :nil },
      to: { empty: :nil, omitted: :omitted, nil: :nil }
    }
  end

  json do
    map 'status', to: :status, value_map: {
      from: { empty: :nil, omitted: :omitted, nil: :nil },
      to: { empty: :nil, omitted: :omitted, nil: :nil }
    }
  end

  toml do
    map 'status', to: :status, value_map: {
      from: { empty: :nil, omitted: :omitted },
      to: { empty: :nil, omitted: :omitted, nil: :omitted }
    }
  end
end
----

For collection attributes, the value_map behaves differently depending on the `initialize_empty` setting.

==== `render_nil` and `render_empty` modes

These options provide shorthand methods to control how nil and empty values are rendered in serialization formats:

* `render_nil: true | :as_empty | :as_blank | :nil | :omit` - Controls how nil values are rendered
* `render_empty: :as_empty | :as_blank | :nil | :omit` - Controls how empty collections are rendered

[source,ruby]
----
class SomeModel < Lutaml::Model::Serializable
  attribute :coll, :string, collection: true

  xml do
    root "some-model"
    map_element 'collection', to: :coll, render_nil: :omit
  end

  json do
    map 'collection', to: :coll, render_empty: :as_nil
  end
end
----

=== Polymorphic model support

From version 0.7.1, Lutaml::Model now supports polymorphic models for attribute
types.

Comprehensive support for polymorphic models has been introduced, allowing for
flexible modeling of inheritance relationships and proper
serialization/deserialization.

This means that you can define attributes that can accept multiple types of
objects, and the library will handle serialization and deserialization for these
types seamlessly.

Specifically, the following features have been added:

* Polymorphic attribute definition
* Polymorphic class differentiation in model and serializations

==== Polymorphic attribute definition

Polymorphic attributes can be defined using the `polymorphic` option.

It is possible to define polymorphic attribute classes in the superclass
and subclasses.

The `polymorphic` option can be set to a collection of classes, and the
`polymorphic_class` option can be set to `true` to indicate acceptance of any
subclass of the polymorphic class. Alternatively, you can specify a collection
of classes to restrict the accepted types.

[source,ruby]
----
class ReferenceSet < Lutaml::Model::Serializable
  attribute :references, Reference, collection: true, polymorphic: [
    DocumentReference,
    AnchorReference,
  ]
end
----

When you are not requiring a specific set of subclasses, you can use the
`polymorphic: true` option to indicate that any subclass of the specified class is
acceptable.

[source,ruby]
----
class ReferenceSet < Lutaml::Model::Serializable
  attribute :references, Reference, collection: true, polymorphic: true
end
----


==== Polymorphic class differentiator

When serializing polymorphic models, a differentiator attribute is required to
also be serialized to identify the specific subclass of the polymorphic class.

This differentiator attribute is typically a string that indicates the type of
the object being serialized. The differentiator attribute can be defined in the
superclass or subclasses of the polymorphic class.

Typically, the differentiator attribute is an XML element or attribute (e.g. `type="document-ref"`), or in JSON a `@`-prefixed key (e.g. `@type`).

A polymorphic differentiator attribute can be set in either the superclass or subclasses:

[source,ruby]
----
# In superclass
class Reference < Lutaml::Model::Serializable
  attribute :_class, :string, polymorphic_class: true
  # ...
end

# Or in subclasses
class DocumentReference < Reference
  attribute :_class, :string, polymorphic_class: true
  # ...
end

# Or in subclasses
class AnchorReference < Reference
  attribute :_class, :string, polymorphic_class: true
  # ...
end
----

Given the differentiator attribute being `_class`, we still need to define the
mapping for the differentiator attribute in the superclass or subclasses.

Polymorphic mapping in serialization is supported through the `polymorphic_map` option:

[source,ruby]
----
class Reference < Lutaml::Model::Serializable
  attribute :_class, :string, polymorphic_class: true

  xml do
    map_attribute "reference-type", to: :_class, polymorphic_map: {
      "document-ref" => "DocumentReference",
      "anchor-ref" => "AnchorReference"
    }
  end

  key_value do
    map "_class", to: :_class, polymorphic_map: {
      "Document" => "DocumentReference",
      "Anchor" => "AnchorReference"
    }
  end
end
----

The `polymorphic_map` option is used to indicate that when serializing a
`DocumentReference` object, the `_class` attribute will be serialized as
`document-ref`, and when serializing an `AnchorReference` object, the `_class`
attribute will be serialized as `anchor-ref`.

This is a mapping-level option so that it can be used in serialization formats
independently.

This will produce a differentiator attribute in the serialized output as such.

[source,yaml]
----
---
references:
- _class: Document
  # other attributes...
- _class: Anchor
  # other attributes...
----


=== Importable model improvements

Importable model functionality has been improved, with better support for reusable models:

* `import_model` - Imports both attributes and mappings
* `import_model_attributes` - Imports only attributes
* `import_model_mappings` - Imports only mappings

Bug fixes for the import_model functionality ensure more reliable model reuse.

=== Circular reference handling

Improved handling of circular references in the `ComparableModel` module prevents stack overflow errors when comparing models with self-referential structures.

== Upgrade guide

=== Missing values handling

If you were previously using `render_nil: true`, you can continue using it, but
you may want to explore the more flexible `value_map` option for fine-grained
control over different serialization formats.

For collection attributes, consider whether you want collections to initialize
as `nil` or as an empty array by setting the `initialize_empty` option
accordingly.

=== Polymorphic models

If you were previously using class detection for polymorphic models without
explicit differentiators, you should now define a polymorphic differentiator
attribute and use the `polymorphic_class: true` option.
