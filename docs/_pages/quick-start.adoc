= Quick start

== Purpose

Lutaml::Model is the Ruby implementation of the LutaML modeling methodology for:

* Creating information models in the LutaML language (or its Ruby DSL)
* Serializing and deserializing LutaML information models
* Accessing data instances of LutaML information models
* Documenting LutaML information models

It provides simple, flexible and comprehensive mechanisms for defining information models with attributes and types, and serializing them to/from Hash, JSON, XML, YAML, and TOML.

== Key features

* **Model-driven design** - Define models with attributes and types
* **Multi-format serialization** - XML, JSON, YAML, TOML, Hash
* **XML namespace support** - Full W3C namespace implementation
* **Validation** - Built-in validation with custom rules
* **Schema generation** - Generate XSD, JSON Schema, YAML Schema
* **Polymorphism** - Handle multiple types elegantly
* **Collections** - Work with groups of models
* **Custom types** - Extend with your own value types

== Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'lutaml-model'
----

Then run:

[source,shell]
----
bundle install
----

== Your first model

Here's a complete example showing model definition and serialization:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'lutaml/model'

class Person < Lutaml::Model::Serializable
  attribute :name, :string
  attribute :age, :integer

  xml do
    root "person"
    map_element "name", to: :name
    map_element "age", to: :age
  end

  key_value do
    map "name", to: :name
    map "age", to: :age
  end
end

# Create an instance
person = Person.new(name: "John Doe", age: 30)

# Serialize to different formats
person.to_xml
# => <person><name>John Doe</name><age>30</age></person>

person.to_json
# => {"name":"John Doe","age":30}

person.to_yaml
# => name: John Doe
#    age: 30

# Deserialize from formats
Person.from_xml(xml_string)
Person.from_json(json_string)
Person.from_yaml(yaml_string)
