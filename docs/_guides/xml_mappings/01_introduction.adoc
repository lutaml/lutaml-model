= Introduction

== Purpose

This guide provides comprehensive documentation for the XML mapping system in
Lutaml::Model, with emphasis on the namespace-aware architecture that properly
models W3C XML Namespace and XSD specifications.

== What changed

The XML mapping system has been enhanced with a new namespace-aware
architecture that correctly implements W3C XML Namespace semantics:

**Architectural improvements:**

* `XmlNamespace` class for declarative namespace metadata

* Type-level namespace support for `Type::Value` and `Serializable` classes

* `element()` as primary API for element declaration

* `root()` maintained as backward-compatible alias

* Type-only models use absence of element declaration instead of deprecated
`no_root`

* `form:` option for per-element qualification control

* `documentation:` option for XSD annotations

**Why these changes:**


* **W3C compliance**: Properly separates Element (XML structure) from Type (data
structure) as orthogonal concepts

* **Namespace semantics**: URI is the identifier, prefixes are just labels

* **XSD generation**: Full support for generating standards-compliant XSD
schemas with proper namespace declarations

* **Reusability**: Namespace definitions centralized and reusable across models

* **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between namespace metadata
and usage

== Backward compatibility

All existing code continues to work:

* String-based `namespace(uri, prefix)` still supported

* `root()` works as before

* `no_root` shows deprecation warning but functions correctly

* No breaking changes to existing models

New features are opt-in and can be adopted incrementally.
